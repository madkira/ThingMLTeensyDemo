# ThingML for Teensy Programming

ThingML ([https://github.com/TelluIoT/ThingML](http://thingml.org/dist/ThingML2CLI.jar)) is a high-level language based on components, asynchronous messaging and finate state machines. Despite a high level of abstraction, ThingML is currently integrating a code generator which is suitable for Teensy as well as other flavors of 32 bits microcontrollers.

This repository provides some simple example to get started with ThingML on Teensy boards.

### Tools versions

Basic Examples have been tested with ThingML v2 on teensy 3.2. These example will *NOT* work with ThingML v1 which should be consired as obsolete.
